A place for any fun stuff that I develop whilst using the [coalesce.io](https://coalesce.io/) app

I'm not claiming to be any kind of jinja templating or coalesce guru, just an enthusiastic experimenter.

If you find anything useful in here then great help yourself, if you have any constructive feedback also great. If you want to re-write any of my dodgy code to make it better then please do because I would love to learn how to do things better.

If you are just going to critisize or generally be a dick, jog on.

Thanks for reading!
